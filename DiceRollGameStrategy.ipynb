        "\n",
        "Consider the following game: you and an opponent each have two fair, 6-sided dice. Each player secretly rolls and looks at their dice. Players alternate proposing statements about the four collective dice, such as \"two 5s\" or \"three 2s.\"\n",

        "1. **Turns**: On their turn, a player can either:\n",
        "    - \"Reject\" the other person's proposal.\n",
        "    - Give a proposal with \"higher\" stakes, by either increasing the number referred to or the total dice in the proposal (e.g., \"two 5s\" < \"two 6s\" < \"three 1s\").\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Rejection**: Once a player \"rejects,\" all dice are revealed:\n",
        "    - If the proposed dice do not exist among the four total dice, the \"rejecter\" wins.\n",
        "    - If the proposed dice do exist, the \"rejecter\" loses.\n",
